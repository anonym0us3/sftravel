        <h3><a href="http://statebirdsf.com/" target="_blank">State Bird Provisions</a></h3>
        <img src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D0UZYWjj-DA8gxDpNOThEvQMhc0=/899x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/924338/IMG_0473-2848220282-O.0.jpg">
        <p>
          San Franciscans endure three-hour waits to eat State Bird Provisions' whimsically Californian menu, served dim-sum style. Whether it's savory pancakes stacked with local cheese, delicious crudos, or a new take on tofu skin, the flavor profiles are always eye-opening, making State Bird one of the most exciting restaurants in town, if not the country.
